# Thermal_Control_System

## Introduction
Developed a thermal control system that could react when temperatures vary drastically. Depending on what button is pressed, either an automatic or manual mode will be triggered, with each represented by an LED. A constant display of the temperature will also be available since it will display both the Celsius and Fahrenheit changes.

## Objectives
* The system read the data from the temperature censor every 1s , converses analog value into Celsius and Fahrenheit degree, and display on the LCD
* The Cortex M3 microcontroller gives command to the Arduino UNO to control the fan in Auto/Manual mode
* Green LED indicates the system is in Auto Mode and the fan will be activated when the environment temperature is higher than 30 degree C
* Red LED indicates the system is in Manual Mode, the user can turn ON/OFF the fan with the button attached on the microcontroller
